# Indoor - Outdoor Image classifier

## Pre-requesites:

- Download pre trained models from google drive
- Place models into **"image-classifier/omnidata/pretrained_models"** folder

  - **_Note: the models have to be downloaded from a drive due to GitHub's file restriction_**
    - Not pushing those files is handled by gitignore

- Fogsphere has a conda environment with the required packages installed. This env can be activated with: `conda activate flask-app`

For any other situation, it is recommended to create a conda environment, and then install the packages in it.

Once the environment has been activated, we can install them by running

    pip install -r packages.txt
